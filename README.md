## Project Abstract
  EmoStocks is a supplementary mobile application designed to assist stock traders in making healthier, emotion-free investment decisions. Recognizing that maintaining records is essential for improving trading profitability, the app encourages users to reflect on their past trades, facilitating opportunities for feedback that can enhance future trading success. Users prone to emotional trading tendencies stand to benefit significantly from this app. EmoStocks starts by analyzing users' investment preferences through a brief initial survey, establishing default settings accordingly. Subsequently, users can record their trades twice daily, before market open and after market close. Users are encouraged to faithfully document their emotions, moods, and trade details each day. EmoStocks leverages this emotional data to generate weekly and monthly reports, providing users with valuable insights akin to a trading diary. Users can comfortably utilize EmoStocks for day-to-day trading while also receiving regular analytical reports to aid them in achieving successful trades based on their emotional history. Ultimately, EmoStocks aims to empower traders to make rational, data-driven decisions and cultivate a healthier approach to stock trading, free from emotional biases.

## Why Emostock
  EmoStocks is targeting customers in the age range of 20 to 40 who are enthusiastic about stock trading, including students and working professionals. Specifically, our app is designed to cater to users who frequently engage in trading but experience significant fluctuations in their profitability, those who enjoy trading but do not maintain records or provide feedback on their past trades, and users who tend to trade emotionally and impulsively. These user segments are our primary focus for EmoStocks.
